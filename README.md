# Weather-Dashboard

## Description
    
    I made this site so people that want to know weather data about a city can look it up and see the temp, wind speed, and humidity. This project was a fun way to learn how to get and use data from a third party API.

## Usage
    When the page laods you are presented with a searchbar that you can input what city you want to see weather data for. The page then loads weather data for that city and presents you with a 5 day weather forecast.
